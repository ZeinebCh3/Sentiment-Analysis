# Sentiment Analysis for Book Reviews üìöüîç

This project is designed to analyze customer reviews of books and extract their sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) using natural language processing (NLP) techniques. By leveraging both traditional methods (like rule-based sentiment analysis) and modern machine learning models, the project aims to provide insights into customer feedback, helping businesses and authors understand their audience better.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Sentiment analysis is a critical aspect of understanding user feedback in various industries. In this project:
- We preprocess a dataset of book reviews to clean and normalize the text data.
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns and distributions in customer sentiment.
- Apply multiple sentiment analysis techniques:
  - Rule-based approaches using NLTK's Vader and TextBlob.
  - Transformer-based deep learning models using Hugging Face's `transformers` library.
- Evaluate the models' performance using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## üìÇ Dataset

The dataset used is `Audible_English_Books.csv`, which contains:
- **Title**: The name of the book being reviewed.
- **Reviews**: Textual customer reviews about the book.
- **Rating**: A numerical or categorical rating provided by the customer.

The dataset is preprocessed to extract and clean relevant columns for analysis, such as removing unnecessary columns and handling missing or noisy data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Features

### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Text Cleaning**:
  - Removal of punctuation, special characters, and unnecessary spaces.
  - Tokenization (breaking text into individual words or tokens).
- **Stop-word Removal**:
  - Eliminates commonly used words (like "the", "and", "is") that do not contribute significantly to sentiment.
- **Text Normalization**:
  - Lowercasing and lemmatization (reducing words to their base forms).

### 2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Generate **word clouds** to visualize the most frequent terms in positive and negative reviews.
- Analyze sentiment distributions using bar plots and histograms.
- Understand the correlation between ratings and sentiment.

### 3. **Sentiment Analysis**
- **Rule-Based Sentiment Analysis**:
  - **Vader** (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner): A pre-trained rule-based model from NLTK for quick and efficient sentiment scoring.
  - **TextBlob**: A lightweight library for sentiment polarity scoring.
- **Transformer-Based Models**:
  - Using Hugging Face's `AutoModelForSequenceClassification` for advanced sentiment classification.
  - Pre-trained models like `BERT` are fine-tuned to classify reviews into sentiment categories.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**
- Metrics for evaluation:
  - **Accuracy**: Overall correctness of the sentiment classification.
  - **Precision**: How many selected items are relevant.
  - **Recall**: How many relevant items are selected.
  - **F1-score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.
